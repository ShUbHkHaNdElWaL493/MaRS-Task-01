# MaRS-Task-01
@ Project-03

The schematics for a motion sensor have been included in the following file.
This sensor has been made using the ultrasonic distance sensor and the PIR sensor.
The motion sensor is used to know if an object is in close proximity with the sensor.
The connections for this design have been made using Arduino Uno for processing the inputs given by the sensors.

The link to the circuit design for the sensor has been attached:
