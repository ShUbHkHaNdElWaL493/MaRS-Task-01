@ Project-01

The schematics for an environment sensor have been included in the following file.
This sensor has been made using the gas sensor and the temperature sensor.
The gas sensor can be used to determine the atmosphere composition at a particular place while the temperature sensor is used to study various temperature differences in different areas.
The connections for this design have been made using Arduino Uno for processing the inputs given by the sensors.

The link to the circuit design for the sensor has been attached:
